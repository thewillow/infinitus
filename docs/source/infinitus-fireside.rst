Infinitus Fireside Community Signal and SimpleX Groups Ground rules and guidelines
------------------------------------

*Version 2.0.0, effective Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025*  


1. Introduction and purposes

The Infinitus Fireside Community Signal and SimpleX Groups are private and encrypted online groups hosted on Signal and SimpleX, respectively. The former is referred to as the "Infinitus Fireside" group, the latter the "Infinitus Wellside" group. 

The primary purposes of this group are:

- Fellowship, edification, and mutual encouragement, as well as peer support as appropriate
- Community building
- Networking
- General communications and feedback related to Infinitus Ministries


2. Joining the group

a. To join the Infinitus Fireside group, one may simply do so by using the URL shortcut https://fireside.infinitusministries.net, which redirects to the Signal invitation page. For security reasons, the actual URL for joining the Signal group may be changed at any time, so if you are inviting your friends, please use the shortcut URL. To join the Infinitus Wellside group, likewise, one may use the URL shortcut, https://wellside.infinitusministries.net, to reach the SimpleX invitation page. 

b. The main target of this group is neurodivergent and queer Christians. Denominational or church affiliations are not important for eligibility to join this group. Others may join if they understand and respect the intentions of this group and exercise good allyship. Members must be at least 18 years of age, or of the age of majority where they reside, whichever is greater. 

c. In order to prevent spam and trolls, the management reserves the right to screen prospective members and deny their request to join for any reason. The management may contact you directly and ask a few questions before authorizing your request.

d. To be part of the Fireside group, you need a Signal app on your smartphone (https://signal.org). While there are desktop versions of Signal for Linux and Windows, they only work if you already have Signal on your phone.

e. To be part of the Wellside group, you need a SimpleX Chat app on your smartphone or desktop computer (https://simplex.chat). 

f. In keeping with the anti-violent religious beliefs and values of Infinitus Community and Infinitus Ministries, any person engaging in violence is not allowed in these groups. This includes anyone who currently, actively, and directly takes part, as their profession or career, in the instruments of systemic or state-sponsored violence (including but not limited to military, paramilitary, national guards, reservists, gendarmerie, defense contractors, police, prison guards, mercenary, government-contracted private prison employees), as well as those who engage in criminal or non-state violence ("militiamen," gangsters, terrorists, street thugs, rapists). We are a peace church. 


3. Rules

a. While Signal and SimpleX are secure, encrypted platforms, the nature of these groups means that you should not disclose or divulge sensitive personal information about yourself or anyone else. Use of these groups for the purpose of "doxxing" or "catfishing" is strictly prohibited, and violators will be immediately expelled and permanently excluded from the groups. 

b. Confidentiality: What is said in this group stays in this group. However, the existence of this rule cannot 100 percent guarantee that everything remains confidential (see the previous point).

c. These groups operate out of Oregon, and the management is considered a mandatory reporter in case of suspected child or elder abuse under the laws of the State of Oregon. While members of the group may come from all parts of the world and we generally do not know where they reside, if it comes to the management’s attention that there may be a case of child or elder abuse taking place within the borders of the State of Oregon, we will notify the Oregon Department of Human Services as required by law.

d. **This group is not intended to be a crisis support line**. If you are in a mental health crisis, or if you threaten suicide, self-harm, or violence toward others, you will be asked to leave and contact an appropriate help, such as calling 988 (from anywhere in the United States and Canada), or Samaritans or Befrienders Worldwide in other parts of the world. While qualified ministers in these groups may offer pastoral care and informal spiritual direction, no one here is a licensed mental health practitioner, and participation in the groups is never intended to be a substitute for any psychological or psychiatric service. Being a member of these groups does not constitute any provider-client relationship.

e. While members are welcome to share what they are doing in life and promote their work, projects, art, events, etc., excessive self-promotion and advertising will result in suspension or termination of their membership.

f. Mutual aid requests: Since there is no easy way to screen genuine mutual aid requests from fraudulent attempts, we do not allow solicitation of money for bills, rent, food, gas, etc. (often called “mutual aid requests”) in this group. Instead, those who are in genuine need should directly message a moderator, and at their sole discretion and discernment, they may send out bulletins outlining community needs. Inclusion in such bulletins is at the sole determination of the management, and those who request help should be prepared to demonstrate need in an objective and accountable manner (your confidentiality is respected).  

g. Civility is a must. No trolling, flaming, gossiping about others behind their backs, no personal attacks, no threats, and no "doxxing."

h. Both Signal and SimpleX allow file uploads. You are welcome to share photos, memes, *original* music recordings, writings, etc. However, please do not upload porn, executable files (such as scripts, APKs, software), excessively large files, or any pirated materials.

i. This is a diverse group of people with different theological and cultural backgrounds. Respect for differences is very important. These are only general guidelines and ground rules and are not an exhaustive list. The management reserves the right to modify or revise these rules at any time at its own discretion and in response to what may happen in the groups.
