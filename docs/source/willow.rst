About Willow   
===================================

**S.A. "Willow" Morrigan** is the founder and the lead minister/spiritual director of Infinitus Ministries. While Willow's aspirations for ministries began quite early as a newly-baptized teenage Christian, the first serious attempt at it was 20 years ago. In 2005, Willow formed what was then termed a "missional" community at a non-profit community center in Portland, Oregon, in part inspired by the Catholic Worker Movement and in part by the emergent church movement. It was sadly short-lived.  

Willow comes with the lived experiences from the intersections of marginalization, oppression, and injustice -- both as direct personal experiences, as well as by living close to and working with those who are at the extreme margins of society.  

Willow has studied at Christian Leaders Institute (Spring Lake, Michigan) since 2021 and earned a Chaplaincy Certificate (41 credits, completed 2023), a Commissioned Pastoral Certificate (43 credits, completed 2024), and a Diploma of Ministry (69 credits, completed 2024). In the past, Willow also received theological and ministry education at now-defunct Ocean Seminary College (Monmouth Beach, New Jersey) and Warner Pacific University (Portland, Oregon). 

Aside from ministries, Willow is an experienced visual artist, as well as a former community organizer and social activist.  

Willow resides in the Tualatin Valley area of Oregon.
