Infinitus Ministries roadmap
============================

*While the visions of Infinitus Ministries are big, prudence requires
that we proceed with careful and measured plans.* Like a tech startup,
we use a **SMART goal setting**: *Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
Realistic, and Time-bound*.

To this end, we prayerfully create a “roadmap” for Infinitus Ministries
based on discernment and careful assessment of our resources.

| **Abbreviations:**
| - IC: Infinitus Community
| - IMR: Infinitus Media and Resources
| - IX: Infinitus Explorations

Summer 2024 (August-September 2024)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  IC: Discipleship/spiritual development programming for autistic
   Christians (digital).
-  IMR: Re-launch of the Little Free Seminary content (text; podcast
   will not resume at this stage).
-  IC: Gauging interest for in-person, informal gatherings in the
   Portland (Oregon) metropolitan area.

Autumn 2024 (September-December 2024)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  IMR: Creation of a neurodivergent inclusion guide for local churches.
-  IC: Possible informal, low-key meet-up in the Portland metropolitan
   area.
-  IC: Opening of a structured online community (on Matrix).
-  IC: Discipleship programming continues (digital).
-  IX: Initial opening of spiritual direction appointments.

Winter 2024-2025 (December 2024-March 2025)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  IMR: Content creation to be on a regular schedule, establishing
   production routines.
-  IC: Informal meet-up to continue. If, at this point, there are enough
   people who can commit to a regular schedule, the group may evolve
   into something more structured (e.g., a study or discussion group).
-  IC: Discipleship programming continues (digital and possibly in
   person).

Spring 2025 (March-June 2025)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  IC: Begin identification and cultivation of potential community
   leaders to delegate some of the tasks.
-  IC: Planning for summer outdoor gatherings (to take place in July and
   August).

**This is a “living document” and is always a work in progress.**
