	**Infinitus Ministries** is a collective brand referring to three distinct things: *Infinitus Explorations*, *Infinitus Media & Resources*, and *Infinitus Community*. This documentation site outlines the overarching vision, missions, and aims of Infinitus, as well as the common foundational elements such as distinctives and values. Beyond those, this site will focus primarily on our community initiatives and how you can participate in and be part of this new community. As Infinitus Community grows, this will be where we will be publishing governance-related documents, policies, and manuals (we eschew bureaucracy so we'll be light on those, though!) for the sake of transparency. Since the docs are recorded on `Github <https://github.com/thewillow/infinitus>`_, one can review past changes and history. Contents specific to *Infinitus Media & Resources* and *Infinitus Explorations* will be found elsewhere.  	
 
Introduction  
-----------------------------------

**Infinitus Ministries** builds up the spiritual life of neurodivergent people of faith through personal spiritual direction practice, resources for church leaders, educational media, and an emergent faith community by and for neurodivergent folks.  

How it began  
-----------------------------------
The seeds of Infinitus Ministries were sown in 2019 when I saw the dearth of spiritual life resources for autistic adults who are often alienated by conventional religious environments and by emotion-driven pop spirituality.  

At the time, nearly all the resources that related to autism and religion were geared toward pastors and parents who needed to put up with their autistic children. There was one that served adult autistic Christians, but it was `primarily for Roman Catholics only <https://autismconsecrated.com>`_.  

According to the estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, approximately `2.8 percent <https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0323-autism.html>`_ of the U.S. population may be autistic (a 2023 estimate). Based on the 2020 decennial census, this makes the autistic population a sizable minority group comparable to the Native Americans and Alaska Natives in size (2.9 percent) and a much larger group than Chinese Americans (1.58 percent).  

So I reasoned: There are many `Native American <https://worship.calvin.edu/resources/resource-library/indigenous-christian-worship-resources-where-to-start>`_-centered churches and even more `Chinese churches in the U.S. <https://www.academia.edu/85864170/Chinese_American_Christianity_How_the_Ethnic_Specific_Church_Interacts_with_the_Processes_of_Migration_and_Americanization>`_, bringing their distinct cultures and lived experiences to faith and worship. For that matter, there are also `deaf churches <https://deafchurchwhere.com/>`_ and `LGBTQ+ churches <https://mccchurch.org/>`_. Why can't we have a church that is rooted in the distinctively autistic life, then?  

For much of 2019, I played with this idea. I couldn't decide whether I should start a one-on-one spiritual direction practice and serve clients from all faith backgrounds or if I should plant a church that could be our own safe and empowering space. In September 2019, I branded the former "Mind Geographic" and prepared to test-market the spiritual direction service. But I soon entered an episode of severe autistic burnout, and then the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic began, putting all this on the back burner.   

In 2021, I returned to school to train in ministry and to earn diplomas in ministry and divinity.  

On Pentecost Sunday, May 19, 2024, I officially present the vision, missions, and upcoming work of Infinitus Ministries.

Vision  
-------------------------------------

``The Spirit of God, the Master, is on me because God anointed me. He sent me to preach good news to the poor, heal the heartbroken, Announce freedom to all captives, pardon all prisoners. God sent me to announce the year of his grace - a celebration of God's destruction of our enemies - and to comfort all who mourn, to care for the needs of all who mourn in Zion, give them bouquets of roses instead of ashes, Messages of joy instead of news of doom, a praising heart instead of a languid spirit. Rename them "Oaks of Righteousness" planted by God to display his glory. They'll rebuild the old ruins, raise a new city out of the wreckage. They'll start over on the ruined cities, take the rubble left behind and make it new. -Isaiah 61:1-4 (MSG)``  

Infinitus Ministries is here to ignite the fourth wave of the Holy Spirit where justice, liberation, healing, happiness, and beauty flourish -- in a world where nobody will be marginalized anymore, and everyone will shine as splendid reflections of God's image.  


Mission
-------------------------------------

Infinitus Ministries is a prophetic mission of the Holy Spirit focused on community-building, advocacy, edification, education, and discipleship. We uplift the voices and lived experiences of neurodivergent people of faith, building up autonomous and self-propagating churches by and for the neurodivergent community, as well as working toward greater inclusion and equity for neurodivergent individuals in other faith communities of all traditions and theological backgrounds.  

What we do
-------------------------------------

**Infinitus Ministries** is a joint brand of three distinctive work components:  

#. **Infinitus Explorations (ix)** (formerly *Mind Geographic*) is a (sliding scale, trades welcome) fee-based `spiritual direction practice <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_direction>`_ helping clients clarify, discover, and expand their belief systems and grow in their faith. This service is open to everyone regardless of their religious beliefs and affiliations and does not proselytize. It is important to note that spiritual direction (also called spiritual companionship) is neither counseling nor personal coaching.  
#. **Infinitus Media & Ministries (im&r)** is a media and resources ministry creating educational content for the general public, as well as producing resources for church leaders helping them create a more inclusive and equitable environment in which autistic and other neurodivergent persons can flourish in the life and leadership of their churches. 
#. **Infinitus Community (ic)** is a newly formed, independent, and post-denominational church led by neurodivergent people for neurodivergent people. Initially, Infinitus Community will be meeting in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area but it is also our goal to organically multiply the church everywhere by cultivating local leadership!
