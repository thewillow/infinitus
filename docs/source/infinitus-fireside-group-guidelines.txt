Version 1.0.0, effective Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024
1. Introduction and purposes
The Infinitus Fireside Community Signal Group is a private and encrypted
online group hosted on Signal. The primary purposes of this group are:
•

Fellowship, edification and mutual encouragement, as well as
peer support as appropriate

•

Community building

•

Networking

•

General communications and feedback related to Infinitus Ministries

2. Joining the group
a.

To join the Infinitus Fireside group, one may simply do so by
using the URL shortcut https://fireside.infinitusministries.n
et which redirects to the Signal invitation page. For security
reasons, the actual URL for joining the Signal group may
be changed at any time, so if you are inviting your friends,
please use the shortcut URL.

b.

The main target of this group are neurodivergent and queer
Christians. Denominational or church affiliations are not
important as eligibilities for joining this group. Others may
join if they understand and respect the intentions of this
group and exercise good allyship.

c.

In order to prevent spam and trolls, the management reserves
rights to screen prospective members and deny their request
to join for any reason. The management may contact you
directly and ask a few questions before authorizing your
request.

d.

To be part of this group, you need a Signal app on your
smartphone ( https://signal.org ). While there are desktop
versions of Signal for Linux and Windows, they only work if
you already have Signal on your phone.

3. Rules
a.

While Signal is a secure, encrypted platform, the nature of
the group means that you should not disclose or divulge
sensitive personal information of yourself or anyone else.

b.

Confidentiality: What is said in this group stays in this group.
However, the existence of this rule cannot 100 percent guarantee that everything remains confidential (see the previous
point).

c.

The management is considered mandatory reporter in case
of suspected child or elder abuse under the laws of the State
of Oregon. While members of the group may come from all
parts of the world and we generally do not know where they
reside, if it comes to the management’s attention that there
may be a case of child or elder abuse, we notify the Oregon
Department of Human Services.

d.

This group is not intended to be a crisis support line. If you
are in a mental health crisis, or if you threaten suicide, selfharm, or violence toward others, you will be asked to leave
and contact an appropriate help, such as calling 988 (from
anywhere in the United States and Canada), or Samaritans
or Befrienders Worldwide in other parts of the world.

e.

While members are welcome to share what they are doing
in life and promote their work, projects, art, etc., excessive
self-promotion and advertising will result in suspension or
termination of their membership.

f.

Mutual aid requests: Since there are no easy way to screen
genuine mutual aid requests from fraudulent attempts, we
do not allow solicitation of money for bills, rent, food, gas,
etc. (often called “mutual aid requests”) in this group.

g.

Civility is a must. No trolling, flaming, gossiping about
others behind their backs, no personal attacks, no threats.

h.

Signal allows file uploads. You are welcome to share photos,
memes, original music recordings, writings, etc. However,
please do not upload porn, executable files (such as scripts,
APKs, software), excessively large files, or any pirated materials.

i.

This is a diverse group of people with different theological
and cultural backgrounds. Respect for differences is very
important.
These are only general guidelines and ground rules and is not an
exhaustive list. The management reserves right to modify or revise
these rules at any time at its own discretion and in response to what
may happen in this group.
