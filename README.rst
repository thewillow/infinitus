The Infinitus Community
=======================================

Hi, I am Willow. I am using this as a simple and geeky way to write documentations about the Infinitus Community. The contents are automatically published at https://infinitus.readthedocs.org.  

This is cool since I can focus on writing instead of wasting time on designing a website, or having to learn to code, or struggle with the slow web-based, no-code CMS solutions.  

Putting this on Git also helps me with transparency and accountability, while also leaving historical records about this project.
