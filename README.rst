Infinitus Ministries  
=======================================

Hi, I am Willow. I am using this as a simple and geeky way to write documentation about Infinitus Ministries, including Infinitus Explorations, Infinitus Media & Resources, and Infinitus Community. The contents are automatically published at https://infinitus.readthedocs.org.  

This is cool since I can focus on writing instead of wasting time on designing a website, having to learn to code, or struggling with the slow web-based, no-code CMS solutions.  

Putting this on Git also helps me with transparency and accountability, while also leaving valuable historical records about this project.  

Follow us on `Instagram<https://instagram.com/infinituscommunity>`_ and `Threads<https://www.threads.net/@infinituscommunity>`_ at @infinituscommunity, or on `Pixelfed (or anywhere in the Fediverse) at @infinitus@shared.graphic<https://shared.graphic/infinitus.>`_!
